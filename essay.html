            <h2>1.Swachh Bharat Abhiyan</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="content">
            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is one of the most significant and popular missions to have taken place in India.<br/> Swachh Bharat Abhiyan translates to Clean India Mission. This drive was formulated to cover all the cities and towns of India to make them clean .<br/>This campaign was administered by the Indian government and was introduced by the Prime Minister, Narendra modi. It was launched on 2nd October in order to honor Mahatma Gandhiâ€™s  vision of a Clean India.</p>
            <h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            <p>The cleanliness campaign of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan was run on a national level and encompassed all the towns, rural and urban. It served as a great initiative in making people aware of the importance of cleanliness.</p>
            <p>Swachh Bharat Abhiyan set a lot of objectives to achieve so that India could become cleaner and better. In addition, it not only appealed the sweepers and workers but all the citizens of the country. This helped in making the message reach wider. It aims to build sanitary facilities for all households. One of the most common problems in rural areas is that of open defecation. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan aims to eliminate that.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Indian government intends to offer all the citizens with hand pumps, proper drainage system, bathing facility and more. This will promote cleanliness amongst citizens.</p>
            <p>Similarly, they also wanted to make people aware of health and education through awareness programs. After that, a major objective was to teach citizens to dispose of waste mindfully.</p>
            <p>Swachh Bharat Abhiyan will help in proper waste management as well. When we will dispose of waste properly and recycle waste, it will develop the country. As its main focus is one rural area, the quality of life of the rural citizens will be enhanced through it.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, it enhances the public health through its objectives. India is one of the dirtiest countries in the world, and this mission can change the scenario. Therefore, India needs a cleanliness drive like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan to achieve this.</p>
            <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
            <p>Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is a great start to make India cleaner and greener. If all the citizens could come together and participate in this drive, India will soon flourish. Moreover, when the hygienic conditions of India will improve, all of us will benefit equally. India will have more tourists visiting it every year and will create a happy and clean environment for the citizens.</p>

            <h2>2.Population</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="content">
            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            <p>Population refers to the total number of beings living in a particular area. Population helps us get an estimate of the number of beings and how to act accordingly. For instance, if we know the particular population of a city, we can estimate the number of resources it needs. Similarly, we can do the same for animals.</p>
            <h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3>
            <p>If we look at the human population, we see how it is becoming a cause of concern. In particular, the third world countries suffer the most from population explosion. As it is the resources there are limited and the ever-increasing population just makes it worse. On the other hand, there is a problem of low population in many regions.</p>
            <p>India faces a major population crisis due to the growing population. If we were to estimate, we can say that almost 17% of the population of the world lives in India alone. India ranks second in the list of most populated countries.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, India is also one of the countries with low literacy rates. This factor contributes largely to the population explosion in India. It is usually seen that the illiterate and poor classes have a greater number of children. This happens mainly because they do not have sufficient knowledge about birth control methods. In addition, more people in a family are equals to more helping hands. This means they have better chances of earning.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we also see how these classes practice early marriage. This makes it one of the major reasons for a greater population. People marry off their young daughters to men way older than them for money or to get free from their responsibility. The young girl bears children from an early age and continues to do so for a long time.</p>
            <p>As India is facing a shortage of resources, the population crisis just adds on to the problem. It makes it quite hard for every citizen to get an equal share of resources. This makes the poor poorer and the rich richer.</p>
            <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
            <p>The human population explosion not only affects humans but also our environment and wildlife. We have seen so many species of birds and animals go extinct because of various factors. As more population requires more resources, deforestation is happening at a faster rate which takes away the homes of these animals. Similarly, their habitat is being destroyed owing to human activities.</p>
