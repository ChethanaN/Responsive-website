            <h2>1.Grandma Climbs A Tree</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="content">
            <p>The poem portrays Ruskin Bond’s unconditional love for his family. This poem shows
                Bond’s ability to enjoy the unusual events and actions.</p>
                <p>The poet admires his Grandma as a genius because she could climb any kind of tall and
                    widespread trees even at the age of 62. When she was advised to grow old gracefully she
                    cheerfully replied that she would rather grow old disgracefully. She had learnt this art of
                    climbing trees from her loving brother at the age of 6.</p>
                    <p>One fine day she climbed a tree and couldn’t come down. After the rescue doctor advised
                        her to take a week bed rest, it was like a brief season in the hell for her. So she ordered her
                        son(poet’s father) to build a tree top house, which as a dutiful son he did. Now grandma
                        lives in the tree house having doors and window poet visits her house everyday and they
                        enjoy the wine drink together.</p>

            <h2>2.Jazz Poem Two</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="content">
            <p>This poem is written in free verse. In this poem like Ancient Mariner in Coleridge’s poem,
                the old jazz musician feels that he has a message for the people of the world. He is a
                pathetic figure, but at the same time a commanding artist. He had power in him to make
                people listen, a gift that not many posses. He is silent in speech but eloquent in music.</p>
                <p>This poem shows the pain of the blacks and their sufferings. In this poem a black old jazz
                    musician feels himself inferior which is expressed by his faded clothes and weary face. He
                    has a rough unshaven face and sagging stomach, he keeps his head down. His shoes are torn
                    out. But when he starts to play suddenly he filled with new life. He is no longer a helpless old
                    man then he becomes the messenger of God preaching gospel of jazz by his old alto
                    saxophone he feels that he has transformed into a bird flying higher and higher from the
                    miseries of the world. He wishes for freedom like this bird. He does not wish to be black
                    man again. But when he completes playing he comes back to original position as black old
                    man.</p>

            <h2>3.I am the Land</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="content">
            <p>The poem I am the Land is written by Marina de Bellagenta. The poem tells about the
                patience of the mother earth. The earth is telling the human beings that they think that they
                own her. But she waits patiently, this poem expresses, how man is destructive towards
                earth. The people shout and proclaim that the land belongs to them. They buy land, drill
                holes, some plough the land, still she waits patiently. Some plant trees, grow fruits, children
                dance and play on the land</p>
               <p> Some times people come and try to fence her and create boundaries which chokes her. The
                mother earth asserts that she is the land and no one can put a fence around the planet
                earth. She waits patiently for people to realize</p>

            <h2>4.The Song of India</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="content">
            <p>The poem ‘The Song of India’ is written by V.K.Gokak. The poem is in the form of
                conversation between mother India and the poet. In this poem the poet wants to present
                glorious picture of the past and also wishes to paint India’s natural beauty</p>
                <p>As Indians we can be proud of our country’s natural beauty, its rich cultural heritage, its
                    ancient wisdom, its glorious freedom struggle and its industrial progress. At the same time
                    we should not ignore the numerous hills affecting our mother land like poverty, diseases,
                    environmental degradation, ignorance, illiteracy, unemployment and a hundred forms of
                    exploitation. We should try to eradicate them. The poet says that our mother India has to
                    write the book of our destiny, cancelling all our sorrows. Tomorrow should be clear dawn,
                    our nightmare should fled in the night. We have to write our bright future.</p>

            <h2>5.Ballad of The Tempest</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="content">
             <p>The poet James T Fields says that faith in God is the solution for all problems through
                his poem ‘Ballad of the Tempest’.</p>
                <p>It was mid night in the winter and all sailors in the crowded cabin were hearing the roar
                    of the hungry sea. They shuddered in silence expecting a shatter by the blast. As they were
                    sitting in the darkness each one was busy with the prayer. They were afraid.</p>
                    <p>When the captain lost his hope and cried “we are lost” ,his little daughter took his icy
                        hand and whispered “Isn’t God upon the ocean, Just the same as on the land”. After
                        sometime everything came to normal. The crew kissed the maiden who spoke cheerfully
                        that the ship is safe at the shore. The faith in God saves and gives courage to them and
                        safely reached the harbour.</p>
